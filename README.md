In this assignment I used the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio.  I created three filesfiles: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.  Using Bootstrap, I developed a portfolio site with a navbar, responsive layouts, and responsive images.  In this assignment I reduced the use of media queries.
